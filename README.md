# REDUX 
        **********WHAT Ä°S REDUX**********

its an open source state managemenr library

which is help us to manage the complex states

simple structure of redux

install library redux toolkit and react-redux

code:
  
$ yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

multiple store are not reccommenden by creater of redux

createSlice :: A function that accepts an initial state, an object of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.


createStore :: A friendly abstraction over the standard Redux createStore function

useSelector/useDispatch::useSelector and useDispatch are a set of hooks to use as alternatives to the existing connect() higher-order component. The equivalent of map state to props is useSelector. It takes in a function argument that returns the part of the state that you want. The equivalent of map dispatch to props is useDispatch. We can invoke useDispatch and store it to a variable, dispatch. Dispatch will work with the allActions imported from the actions folder.


we have to export both our actions and reducers :: counterSlice actions: increment decrement reducers: counterSlice.reducer;

in this tutorial so redux store.js is main thing we have to import our action part

        *********STRUCTURE**********


Redux part:: main component is store inside of app folder we have to import our redux in here and write our calling function inside of reducers
other component:: counterSlice is our action of what we want with redux 
Counter.js:: ui part we use useselector and usedispatch for using redux useSelector for select our redux action usedispatch for use our redux action 

all of them have to in index.js part we create them with provide and store 

and app.js part we add counter in it 

(a && b) does not even evaluate b if a is falsy and returns a straight away; but if a is truthy, the it evaluates and returns b

(a || b) does not even evaluate b if a is truthy and returns a, but if it's falsy, then it evaluates and returns b

payload:: as far as i understant payload is aomunt of action to pass other side 


substring() => The substring() method extracts characters, between two indices (positions), from a string, and returns the substring.


nanoid:: generate random id 


        ***************Redux-example2***************

First of all we create store.js with configureStore() function 

//!what is configureStore():It is the structure that allows the definition of reducers. In general, it is defined in index.js or store.js in a folder named store.

secondly we create features folders for 

features : It is the folder where the slice components are located. (createSlice) is defined and for each Slice file (slice.reducer, slice.actions) it is defined when export operations are made.

then create Slice component for reducer and actions with createSlice function
 

createSlice :: Allows the creation of slice components. In createSlice; We need to define name, initialState and reducers. 
name : The name of the reducer. 
initialState : initial State i. 
reducers : functions to run.

whan we import slice component to the store.js we have to use with xxxReducer and import its how to use this; (forexample:: postsReducers)

and we create postList.js for what postSlice can do its a some kind of create action for postReducers and we import postList into our app.js part for show


useSelector :: useSelector(state => state.reducer); Information about reducer in state can be accessed. useSelector will detect this change immediately as a result of changing states.

payload :: form data that we send or we actually dispatch
