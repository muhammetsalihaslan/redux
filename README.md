createStore :: A friendly abstraction over the standard Redux createStore function

useSelector/useDispatch::useSelector and useDispatch are a set of hooks to use as alternatives to the existing connect() higher-order component. The equivalent of map state to props is useSelector. It takes in a function argument that returns the part of the state that you want. The equivalent of map dispatch to props is useDispatch. We can invoke useDispatch and store it to a variable, dispatch. Dispatch will work with the allActions imported from the actions folder.
